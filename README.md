# Fibonacci (Ruby)

## Question
[Project Euler - Problem #2](https://projecteuler.net/problem=2)

"Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms."

Instructions: 
Construct a solution using Ruby that could be incorporated into a larger project. Consideration should be given to readability, testability, and extensibility. 

## Setup

I had no problems ruby 2.6.5 and 2.7.1 but i had issues with ruby 3.  So I recommend just using a version lower than 3.  I didn't fix this edge case because of the time box

1. Install version of ruby between 2.0 and 3.0
1. Install Bundler

    ```sh
    gem install bundler
    ```

1. Install the gems for this project

   ```sh
   bundle install
   ```
1. Run the tests

   ```sh
   bundle exec rspec
   ```



## Solution
I'm using a combination of caching and recursion. The speed is something around O(log n), but i'm fuzzy on the details because of the caching.
